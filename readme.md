**THIS IS AN OLD REPOSITORY**  
I intentionally leave this repository available to remember me how I was coding back in 2012!  
Please don't clone or use this repo because is certainly out of date!

LessMixin
=========

__mixin.less__ supplies a lot of **utility mixins** to use into your _LESS projects_ to write less and more DRY code.

There are mixins for _block_ and _inline-block_ cross-browser compatibility, _masking items_, _absolute positioning_ shortcuts, create _sprites_ easily.

There also are mixins to **easily implement CSS3 behaviors** without need to remember all browser-specific prefixes!

**IMPORTANT:**  
This repo also contains an **index.html** file. Duble click on it to open a **complete set of examples and documentation** to learn how to use provided mixins.
